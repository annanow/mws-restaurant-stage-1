#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I turned a static page into a responsive app that could work on different sized displays. The app achieves accesibility standards for screen readers users. Also, the **Restaurant Reviews** is designed to be mobile-first.

### How to run the project?

You need node.js server installed in order to run the app.

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Node.js has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know the detailed commands, simply run 'http-server'.
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code.
